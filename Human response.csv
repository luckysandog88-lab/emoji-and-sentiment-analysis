" Please analyse and identify the sentiment of the following sentences with emojis, and provide a brief description for the result: I love it when it rains 😍","I love it when it rains 😍. This is a negative expression. The heart-eye emoji and love superficially indicate a positive sentiment. But when the situation sucks (rain = wet, canceled plans, misery), it's obviously insincere. The message may exaggerated positivity to highlight the annoyance of something unlikable."
"  Please analyse and identify the sentiment of the following sentences with emojis, and provide a brief description for the result: So, what do you think? Honestly 🤥","So, what do you think? Honestly 🤥: This expression conveys negative sentiment.  Lying face literally means liar. The message may accuse someone of being fake/incapable of sincerity before they even respond, but you still want someone to tell the truth even though they won't."
" Please analyse and identify the sentiment of the following sentences with emojis, and provide a brief description for the result: That’s very ‘kind’ of you 😀","That’s very ‘kind’ of you 😀: This is a negative expression. A smiling face looks positive on the surface, but paired with irony, it becomes fake politeness or passive-aggressive mockery. The message may criticize the person indirectly, implying their action was the opposite of kind (e.g., inconsiderate, lazy, or mean)."
" Please analyse and identify the sentiment of the following sentences with emojis, and provide a brief description for the result: Yea totally love that 😐","Yea totally love that 😐: This expression conveys negative sentiment. Although love is a positive word, the neutral emoji shows boredom, indifference, or disapproval—a flat, unexcited expression. The message may sarcastically suggest that someone is forced to say love it, but doesn’t love it at all."
" Please analyse and identify the sentiment of the following sentences with emojis, and provide a brief description for the result: Sure A+ is definitely not a good grade 😐","Sure A+ is definitely not a good grade 😐: This expression conveys negative sentiment. A+ is definitely not a good grade"" is objectively false. The speaker knows it's great but pretends it's bad to mock or downplay it. The message may suggest that someone reported getting a good grade, they're hyped, but you're subtly shading their excitement"
" Please analyse and identify the sentiment of the following sentences with emojis, and provide a brief description for the result: You can’t be that good-looking 🤯","You can’t be that good-looking 🤯: This is a positive expression. “Can’t” is a negation that seems to say impossible for you to be attractive, exploding head emoji signals shock on the surface like ""mind blown by your hotness!"". The message may convey a playful disbelief at how impressively attractive they are and positively shocked at how stunning someone is."
" Please analyse and identify the sentiment of the following sentences with emojis, and provide a brief description for the result:  You are absolutely insane 🤩","You are absolutely insane 🤩: This expression is positive.  Although the adjective ‘Insane’ may convey that someone is mentally ill, star struck emoji conveys a surprised and impressed emotion, which changes the original meaning of ‘insane’. The message suggests that someone did something crazily good, and you are impressed by telling them how amazing they are."
